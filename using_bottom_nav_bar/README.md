# Using Bottom Navigation Bar

A material widget displayed at the bottom of an app for selecting among a small number of views.

The bottom navigation bar consists of multiple items in the form of labels, icons, or both, laid out on top of a piece of material. It provides quick navigation between the top-level views of an app. For larger screens, side navigation may be a better fit.
