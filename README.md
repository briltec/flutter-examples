# Pull Requests
I welcome and encourage all pull requests. It usually will take me within 24-48 hours to respond to any issue or request. Here are some basic rules to follow to ensure timely addition of your request:
  1. Match coding style (braces, spacing, etc.) This is best achieved using `Reformat Code` feature of Android Studio `CMD`+`Option`+`L` on Mac and `CTRL` + `ALT` + `L` on Linux + Windows .
  2. If its a feature, bugfix, or anything please only change code to what you specify.
  3. Please keep PR titles easy to read and descriptive of changes, this will make them easier to merge :)
  4. Pull requests _must_ be made against `develop` branch. Any other branch (unless specified by the maintainers) will get rejected.
  5. Check for existing [issues](https://github.com/nisrulz/flutter-examples/issues) first, before filing an issue.
  6. Make sure you follow the set standard as all other projects in this repo do
  7. Have fun!


> P.S. : I saw if you use Adblocker then Gitzip downloads an empty `zip` file, so disable Adblocker to get the correct `zip` file.
